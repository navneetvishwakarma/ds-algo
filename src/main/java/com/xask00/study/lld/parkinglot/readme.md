Hereâ€™s a **Low-Level Design (LLD)** challenge for todayâ€”perfect for showcasing your ability to model classes, apply design patterns, and think in an object-oriented way.

## ðŸš— **Design a Parking Lot System**

### ðŸŽ¯ **Problem Statement**

Design a parking lot with multiple floors, each containing multiple parking spots. Support functionality to:

* **Park** and **unpark** vehicles (cars, bikes, trucks).
* **Search** for a parked vehicle by registration number.
* **Query** the count of free spots by vehicle type on each floor.

### ðŸ’¡ **Why It Matters**

* Commonly asked in interviews ([github.com][1], [medium.com][2])
* Demonstrates class modeling, inheritance (vehicle types), composition (floors and spots), and use of design patterns.
* Great chance to showcase best practices like SOLID principles, Strategy pattern, and clean architecture.

## ðŸ”§ **Today's Task Breakdown**

| Step                              | Task                                                                                                                                                                               |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Clarify Requirements**       | Multi-floor lot, multiple vehicle types, ability to track by license plate, count empty spots.                                                                                     |
| **2. Identify Major Classes**     | `ParkingLot`, `ParkingFloor`, `ParkingSpot`, `Vehicle`, `ParkingStrategy` (for spot assignment).                                                                                   |
| **3. Define Relationships**       | Composition: lot contains floors, floors contain spots; spot can hold a vehicle.                                                                                                   |
| **4. Choose Design Patterns**     | - **Strategy** for algorithms like nearest spot or even distribution.<br> - **Factory** for creating vehicles or spots.<br> - Optional: **Observer** to notify when floor is full. |
| **5. Specify Key APIs**           | - `parkVehicle(Vehicle v) â†’ SlotID or failure`<br> - `unparkVehicle(String plateNumber)`<br> - `getAvailableSpots(VehicleType type, int floor)`                                    |
| **6. Detail Internal Mechanisms** | - **Mapping** from license plate to spot.<br> - **Spot allocation** via queue or priority per floor.<br> - **Type-based tracking** using counters or maps.                         |
| **7. Add Edge Cases**             | Lot full, invalid unpark, resetting state, concurrent parking if going multi-threaded.                                                                                             |
| **8. Extend & Optimize**          | - Add vehicle hourly fees.<br> - Implement **thread-safe** operations.<br> - Use **Factory Method** for spot types (compact, large, EV).                                           |

## ðŸ§  **Bonus: Pattern & Principles Checklist**

* **Single Responsibility**: Each class handles a specific concern.
* **Open/Closed**: New vehicle types or parking rules added without modifying existing code.
* **Strategy Pattern**: Define different `ParkingStrategy` implementations to place vehicles.
* **Factory Pattern**: Use a `VehicleFactory` or `SpotFactory` to encapsulate object creation.

## âœ… **What You Should Produce Today**

1. **UML Class Diagram**: Showing classes, their relationships, and major methods.
2. **Core Code Skeleton**: Interfaces and class stubs with key methods.
3. **Sample Implementation**: One strategy (e.g., nearest available spot), with parking/unparking support.
4. **Test Scenarios**: Use-cases such as parking, unparking, querying available slots.
5. **Write-Up**: Explain design choices, applied patterns, and any assumptions or trade-offs.

This exercise perfectly hits the mark for LLD interviewsâ€”complex enough to demonstrate your software architecture skills yet manageable to complete in one session. When you're done, Iâ€™d be glad to review your UML diagram, code structure, or discuss possible extensions!
